    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Surface mining](https://americanmineservices.com/types-of-surface-mining) refers to the removal of the terrain surface to access minerals underneath. In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. Surface mining is often more cost-effective than gouging tunnels and subterranean shafts to access minerals underground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although surface mining contributes to the source of income for a country, these operations can result in deleterious impacts on farmlands, forests, and water bodies. Government officials are making efforts to identify areas of these mining activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a method for identifying areas where there is surface mining activities. The notebook combined with methods based on vegetation loss and water detection. Although the notebook aids in detecting these areas further verification by government agencies or institutions are required to validate the operations on the ground."

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface mining operations often result in the clearing of vegetation and the develpoment of water from the land. Using remote sensing images Sentinel-2 and DE Africa's Water Observations from Space (WOfS) product, this notebook screen areas where there is a possibility of surface mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses Normalised Difference Vegetation Index from Rouse 1973 (NDVI) to determine vegetation loss using a threshold less than Zero. Water indices used are DE Africa's Water Observations from Space (WOfS), Normalised Difference Moisture Index from Gao 1996 (MNDWI) and Water Index from Fisher 2016 (WI) for the surface water. The three water indices compliment each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final product is the combination of the Vegetation loss pixel and the pixel of water to get the mining pixel of an area.\n",
    "In most cases, these algorithms can be used to identify clusters of pixels that have experienced change and allow targeted investigation of those areas by local or regional governments."
